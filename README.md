## instructions for the drawing machine

### switching colors
when it comes to switching colors in the drawing machine, all you have to do is click on the SPACE key. your color will switch from red to blue and you'll have to run the code again to go back to blue.

### using the drawing machine
imagine the drawing machine as a easel. you're free to do what you want, as long as you can manage to stay between red and only switch to blue when you're done with drawing the red part of your art.
you can double click the screen with your mouse to clear your canvas, though you'll be stuck on whatever red if you chose red, if you are still on blue, you may still switch to red with the SPACE key.


## that's it
i hope you enjoy the drawing machine, have fun and be creative!
